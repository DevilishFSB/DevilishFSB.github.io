## Sistema Interpretativo Inacreditavelmente Simples (SIIS)

# Introducão

Já imaginou criar uma historia em que um aventureiro espacial, um investigador vitoriano e um ladino clássico se aventuram juntos através de várias dimensões, mas você não consegue fazer os jogadores lerem 2 páginas de regras básicas? Com o SIIS você poderá fazer isso e muito mais.

Com excessão de fazer os jogadores lerem as regras. Partindo do pressuposto de que o Mestre será o único a ler este panfleto, eu resolvi escrever este pequeno apanhado de regras simples, com o qual eu espero que você crie histórias excinatntes com seus amigos de atenção limitada.

SIIS é um sistema fácil de aprender, mas há regras avançadas opcionais para o caso de você decidir apimentar sua campanha. Sinta-se livre para adicionar suas próprias regras ou mudar as regras atuais para se adequar ao estilo de seus jogadores. Lembre-se de que o mais importante é que seu grupo se diverta com elas.

# O que Você Precisa para Mestrar?

Você não precisará de nenhum tipo de equipamento caro para jogar com estas regras: apenas alguns conhecidos (pelo menos 1 já serve), alguns lápis, borrachas e papéis. Opcionalmente, vários tipos de dados (4, 6, 8, 10, 12 e 20 lados -  Opcionais porque esses dados fazem um barulho muito legal quando caem).

Se você se sentir que pode, você pode usar papel quadriculado e miniaturas especiais para marcar a posição dos personagens durante suas aventuras, mas isso é puramente opcional. Às vezes, é melhor deixar o jogo todo acontecer em sua imaginação coletiva.

# Porque estou dizendo para você Mestrar?

Como eu disse, este livreto parte do pressuposto de que apenas o Mestre vai ler as regras.

O **Mestre** é quem age como árbitro de regras e controla todos os aliados e oponentes que entrarem no caminho dos personagens dos jogadores. O Mestre também é responsável por criar o cenário com o qual seus personagens deverão interagir.

Mas não se engane: já vi jogadores compararem a função do Mestre ao de um console eletrônico, com a única função de reagir aos comandos vocais dados para seus personagens.

Na verdade, o Mestre é mais como o roteirista por trás do roteiro de um jogo eletrônico. As regras são a linguagem de programação utilizada para interpretar o mundo de jogo, enquanto o console na verdade é a imaginação coletiva do grupo.

# Criando seu Personagem

Each player needs a character to take part in the story. Depending on the genre that your group wants to play, the character could be an interstellar smuggler, a modern day assassin or even a ninja owl. No matter what universe you decide to play in, each character has the same set of attributes:

Cada jogador precisa de um personagem para participar da história. Dependendo do gênero que seu grupo quer jogar, o personagem pode ser um contrabandista interestelar, um assassino moderno ou mesmo uma coruja ninja. Independentemente do universo em que você decida jogar, cada personagem possui o mesmo atributo:

AGÊNCIA – este atributo determina quão bem versado o personagem é em todo tipo de situação. Um herói em geral possui mais AGÊNCIA que um civil comum, enquanto um civil comum geralmente têm mais AGÊNCIA que uma fatia de pão.

O valor incial de AGÊNCIA para a maioria das campanhas é **Seis**, mas pode ser que como Mestre você se sinta mais confortável com um valor menor ou maior.

Apartir da AGÊNCIA, calcula-se vários tipos de subvalores. Os principais são **Pancadas** e **Inspiração**.

**Pancadas** - Igual a seu valor de AGÊNCIA * 2. Indica quantos acertos o personagem pode receber antes de ser derrotado em combate. Recupera-se 2 Pancadas por hora de descanso.

**Inspiração** - Igual a seu valor de AGÊNCIA +3. Gaste 1 ponto de Inspiração para aumentar o dano de um ataque em mais uma Pancada ou diminuir o dano recebido em 1 Pancada. Recupera-se 1 ponto de Inspiração por dia de descanso.

# Fleshing out your character

Once you have your attributes, you need to get some meat on your character's bones. Give them a name, an occupation and a back-story. The more detail the better, but don't go overboard

- give room for development through storytelling. For example, Susan's smart character is going to be a physicist in her modern day espionage game. She calls her Melissa Stryker, an only-child from a very wealthy family. Susan then details how Melissa came to work at the Cyberware Corporation and what her experimental goals are.

# _Optional Rule: Narrative Points_

Every character is assigned 1 narrative point at the start of every adventure. Narrative points are
a tool to put the story in the players' hands, allowing them to spend them to change the outcome
of a situation. It essentially allows the players to overwrite what the GM has planned in the
players' favour. For instance, Susan could spend her narrative point to create a convenient med-
kit in the room when there's a medical emergency. However, the GM can deny the use of a
narrative point if she thinks it's too overpowered, but may provide another way of using the point.


Specialisms
A character may choose three specialisms. Specialisms show specific skills and knowledge the
character has acquired through her adventures. There is no set skill list because to cover everygenre would take a hell of a long time, so try and think of something yourself and run it by your
GM to make sure it's appropriate. For Melissa, Susan could choose 'Physics' as one of her
specialisms. A specialism is tied to an attribute and give a +2 bonus to that attribute's die roll
when the specialism is used. With Melissa, her 'Physics' specialism is tied to Wits, so she gains
a +2 when rolling for Wits (d10) when dealing with the subject of physics.
Specialisms are written on character sheets with their bonus in brackets, such as Physics (+2).
Examples of Specialisms
Action: Long Jump, Running, Throwing, Strong, Quick Reflexes, Gymnastics, Endurance,
Intimidating.
Wit: Physics, Deduction, Mathematics, Observant, Trickster, Disguise, Sneaky, Strategic.
Ego: Leadership, Bartering, Initiative, Charming, Musician, Empathetic, Manipulative.

Example of a character

Ego **–** Leadership (+2)
_Melissa is a physicist working at Cyberware on a secret project that could revolutionise nuclear_

_energy. She is friendly, but won't stand to be pushed around by others. She shows greatleadership in the most stressful of situations and always tends to know the right thing to do in an_ (^)
_emergency. Her goals are to a) win the Nobel Prize for physics b) lead mankind into a better
future and c) break up with her good-for-nothing boyfriend._


# Playing the game

Here we look at how the game is played, from how to race motorcycles against punk bikers to
blasting holes in outlaws with your six-shooter.
Contested Attribute Tests

There will come a time in every game when a player is put in direct conflict with someone orsomething. This could be a bake-off, court battle or motorbike race, whatever it is there's a really (^)
simple way of working out who comes out on top.
When someone is actively competing against someone else the player makes an attribute test.
Both the player and the GM (or another player if it involves another character) rolls a die
corresponding to the relevant attribute. If the player was locked in an arm wrestle with a Parisiansock merchant, both would roll their Action attributes. The highest roll wins the contest. On a tie the (^)
test is re-rolled until there is a clear winner.
Non-Contested Attribute Tests
Sometimes the player won't be in direct competition with anyone else. Perhaps they're trying to
climb a mountain or weld metal on a space walk. Here they must roll their relevant attribute on adifficulty table to see whether they succeed.
_For example, Melissa the physicist is tied up in the back of a car. She must first break her bonds
and then escape the car safely. Her player tells the GM that Melissa will try and escape from her
bonds. The GM asks for a medium Action roll (the bonds aren't particularly tight). The player rolls a5, which is a success. Melissa escapes from her bonds and now must get out of the car. She
opens the door and flings herself onto the pavement. This is a dangerous move, so the GM asks
for a medium Wit roll, on the count of having to angle herself right for the fall. She rolls a 3 – she isunsuccessful! Melissa bounces hard off the pavement and injures herself. The GM rules that
Melissa deducts 2 from her Hits score for her wound._
Difficulty Table
Successful Roll Difficulty
2+ Easy _(e.g. Jumping a small fence, working out a simple maths problem)_
4+ Medium _(e.g. Riding a horse, rock climbing)_
7+10+ HardVery Hard _(e.g. Breaking into a safe, hot-wiring a car)(e.g. Understanding a foreign language, building a robot)_
14+ Impossible _(e.g. Disproving relativity, downing a bottle of tequila without
vomiting)_


# Combat

Fighting is handled in the same way as contested attribute tests but with a little extra added on. Allcontested rolls use the Action attribute during combat, but in this instance one participant is the

attacker and he other is the defender. If the attacker rolls higher than the defender then theattacker has scored a hit and the defender's Hits score is reduced by the difference between the (^)
winning and losing rolls. When Hits reach 0 the character is dead. Alternatively the GM may rule
that the character is merely unconscious. Hits may be regained through healing, but may never goabove the initial score.
_For example, Melissa is fighting an intruder. Melissa rolls 6 on her Action attribute and the GM rollsa 4 for the intruder. The intruder then has his Hits reduced by 2 (6-4=2)._
Weapons and Armour
Weapons can give bonuses in combat, giving one side the edge over the other. Each weapon typegives a bonus to the Action roll when attacking. Weapon types are as follows:
Light weapon +1 (e.g. short sword, handgun, club)
Medium weapon +2 (e.g. Uzi, claymore, laser repeater)
Heavy weapon +3 (e.g. flamethrower, gatling gun, plasma rifle)
The character only gets a weapon bonus on their attack roll, not their defence roll.
Similarly, armour can be used to negate the effects of being hurt. Each armour type reduces the
number of Hits taken in combat.
Light armour -1 (e.g. jerkin, gauntlets, light bullet-proofs)
Medium armour -2 (e.g. bullet-proof vest, chainmail)
Heavy armour -3 (e.g. plate mail, riot gear, Nebulon Steel)
_For example, Melissa picks up a pistol and shoots at the intruder. The pistol is considered a
medium weapon so she would get +2 to her Action roll. She rolls a 5 and adds the 2, resulting in
a total of 7. The intruder rolls his Action die with a result of 5. Ordinarily he would take 2 hits, but
he has found a metal dustbin lid that counts as light armour, so he reduces the hits by 1,
knocking the remaining 1 from his Hits score. The bullet got through but the makeshift shield
slowed it down._
These examples are by no means the only weapons and armour that you can have in a game.
The GM could create a rocket launcher that gives the character a +5 bonus or a suit of armour
that's a -4. Just use the above examples as guidelines and have fun making up your own bad-ass creations.
How combat flows
It's up to you how you want combat to play out. You could play it fast and loose, going round the
table clockwise to determine the order players act in, or you could assign each player an
initiative score based on their Wits roll + their Action roll, the acting order going from highest tolowest.
During combat a player may take two **different** actions: including but not limited to moving and
attacking. USR keeps movement fairly abstract because of the nature of the generic system, so
it's up to the GM to determine how far a character can move. 20Ft per action is generally a good
guideline when on foot.


Using specialisms in combat
Characters can use their specialisms in order to gain an edge in combat situations. For example,
Melissa wants to identify what liquid is in the beaker on the table. As her first action she uses her
Chemisty specialism to try and figure out whether it might be useful in combat. The GM says it's
a hard difficulty roll. She rolls a 7 and adds 2 for her specialism, giving a result of 9 – a success!
The GM tells her it's a bottle of hydrochloric acid. As her second action, she picks up the acid
and flings it at her opponent. She rolls her Action die +1 for the acid and scores a hit!
If the character has a specialism that directly affects combat, like Sniper, they can use their first
action to make an attribute test with the difficulty determined by the GM. If they are successful
then they get an extra +1 when rolling to attack.
_For example, Bert is a police officer who has the Handguns specialism. He's facing down a perp
but he's hiding behind a hostage. He chooses to roll his Handgun specialism. The GM rules that
because of the hostage, this will be a hard difficulty roll. Bert rolls a total of 8 and is successful.
On his next action he shoots at the perp. He rolls a total of 7 (die + medium weapon +
specialism bonus). The perp rolls a 3, taking 4 hits! It looks like Bert's going to be getting a
promotion._


# Optional Rule: Character

# Advancement

A lot of people like their characters to gain experience through their adventures and advance
their abilities. USR has an optional rule for this, but you're more than welcome to change the rule
to suit your play style.
Every character accrues experience points (xp) during adventures which represents their abilityto learn new skills. Once they have racked up a certain amount of xp they can advance a level,
giving them a new specialism or giving them an extra +1 to a current specialism. A single
specialism can have a maximum of +5.
_For example, Melissa has enough experience points to progress to 2nd level. She can either
choose to give one of her current 3 specialisms a +1 bonus, making it +3, or learning a new
specialism, like 'Motorbikes'._
As stated earlier, your choice of specialism should fit the character if you want to have a good,

rounded roleplaying experience. A nuclear scientist is probably not going to gain a specialism in'Animal Training', so remember to keep it logical. It's a good idea to keep track of what you have (^)
done during that level of play to see if you can weave a specialism in off the back of a
particularly notable success.
As well as gaining a specialism, the character also adds 5 to her total Hits score. This becomes
the character's new initial Hits total.
Experience points are given at the end of each session. They can be awarded for excellent
roleplaying, a particularly ingenious idea or perhaps great teamwork. One point should be
awarded for each example, so it's not unusual for a player to get only one point per session.
